                    <p>Something wicked this way comes &mldr; to the small hamlet of Hawkins, Indiana. Worse yet, it was invited. It all began in 1983, when a mysterious agency pried open a doorway to another, darker realm. Those in the know called it the Upside Down, and some were lost to its inky void. Only a very few have found themselves in that world and made it back alive. Will Byers, then 12, was lost for days down there. And when he was finally rescued, he was not quite the same. You would think that everyone would have learned their lesson and sealed the doorway to the Upside Down forever. Yeah, not so much.</p>
                    <p>Blame the Russians. That is pretty much what every red&#45;blooded American did back in 1985, when Stranger Things 3 opens. Even though the paranormally&#45;gifted Eleven (El) seemed to shut the door on the Upside Down for good a year before (in Season 2), our comrades back in the U.S.S.R. are trying to open another such portal. And somehow, even though the old Soviet Union is a good half&#45;world away, Hawkins is still very much a piece of this Upside Down cake.</p>
                    <p>El&apos;s father, Sheriff Jim Hopper, thinks another evil is afoot &mdash; one in the guise of El&apos;s bowl-coiffed boyfriend, Mike. Sure, they have all been through some tough times together. They are three of the very few people who have seen what lurks in the Upside Down and lived to tell about it.</p>
