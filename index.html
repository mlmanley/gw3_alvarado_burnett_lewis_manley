                <p>Something wicked this way comes &mldr; to the small hamlet of Hawkins, Indiana. Worse yet, it was invited It all began in 1983, when a mysterious agency pried open a doorway to another, darker realm. Those in the know called it the Upside Down, and some were lost to its inky void. Only a very few have found themselves in that world and made it back alive. Will Byers, then 12, was lost for days down there. And when he was finally rescued, he wasnâ€™t quite the same.</p>
                <p>You would think that everyone would have learned their lesson and sealed the doorway to the Upside Down forever. Yeah, not so much.</p>
